            something better than 'ms' on the latency axes.

2013-03-18: Ensure compatibility with a wider range of python versions.

2013-03-18: Do not fail horribly on write permission errors.

2013-03-11: Preforking runner implementation (hopefully fixes issues on FreeBSD).

2013-03-11: Be smarter about picking a `ping` binary, trying first fping
            then falling back to straight ping.

2013-02-20: Workaround for bad exit codes on bsd.

2013-02-14: Release v0.4.2.

2013-01-25: Encode title in data set filename if set.

2013-01-22: Fix possible divide by zero error on certain data values.

2013-01-22: Get rid of the colons in the time stamps used for file names (they
            give rise to escaping headaches).

2012-12-20: Release v0.4.1.

2012-12-20: Fix cutoff logic when end cutoff value is 0.

2012-12-20: If there are missing data values when doing a CDF plot, the plot
            should cut off at a probability < 1; i.e. use the total size of the
            data (including null data points) as data set size when calculating
            probability.

2012-12-17: Release v0.4.0.

2012-12-13: Release v0.3.0.

2012-12-13: Lookup hostnames before starting runners and determine default IP
            version from them. Thanks to David Woodhouse for the suggestion.

2012-12-13: Add workaround for bug in old matplotlib versions that broke
            exporting of plots.

2012-12-10: Add options to turn off annotation, legend and title on plots
            (--no-annotation, --no-legend and --no-title resp.).

2012-12-10: Add automatic switching to log scale for regular plots as well as
            cdf plots. For regular plots, data differing by more than a factor
            of 20 triggers log scaling.

2012-12-10: Add rtt_fair test.

2012-12-10: Fix spurious error when running netperf-wrapper with a test name
            that is also an existing file name (that is, make the error message
            intelligible).

2012-12-09: Automatically switch CDF plots to log scale if the median values
            differ by more than an order of magnitude.

2012-12-09: Support multiple -i options to combine several result sets into one
            table/set of plots. Basically, reading in multiple data sets by
            supplying -i multiple times on the command line now plots them all
            together; this does not work well for all plots, but for some it
            does. Differentiating between the data sets is done by the title
            (set with -t) of the result sets (i.e. -t must be supplied when the
            data set is generated).

2012-12-09: Put custom (-t) plot titles on the same line as the plot name
            (otherwise the title overlaps the plot area for plots exported to
            file).

2012-12-09: Handle errors on data file open better.

2012-12-09: Add rrul46compete test.

2012-12-07: Release v0.2.0.

2012-12-07: Merge compatibility fixes with py3k. Should now work with python
            versions from 2.6 to 3.3.

2012-12-07: Fix compatibility with python2.6.

2012-12-06: Fix to avoid interpolation artifacts at start/end of data series.
