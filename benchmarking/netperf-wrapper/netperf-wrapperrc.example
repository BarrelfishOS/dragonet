## Sample rcfile for netperf-wrapper. Allows options to be specified
## on a global or per-test basis. The file is divided into sections with
## section headers between square brackets.
##
## Options specified in the [global] section apply to everything, while
## further sections specify options that are specific for the test name
## corresponding to the section name.
##
## Comments start with # or ;, and option names are case insensitive.
## The supported options are listed with commentary below. Options specified
## on the command line override options set in the rcfile.
##
## To use: Copy to ~/.netperf-wrapperrc and edit, or specify location of
## the file with --rcfile.

# Default test target host(s).
# Corresponding command line option: --host (or unqualified argument).
# Multiple values are separated by commas.

# Corresponding command line option: --step-size

# Test length (not including delay before starting test).
# Corresponding command line option: --length
;length = 60

# Delay from start of test to the rest of the test starts (only some tests).
# Typically used to delay bandwidth loaders after starting latency measurements;
# the total runtime, for tests that use delay, typically becomes length+2*delay.
# Corresponding command line option: --delay
;delay = 5

# Output file; defaults to standard output (or an interactive viewer for plots)
# if a graphical display is available. Note that for some output modes (e.g. plots),
# the output file name determines file format.
# Corresponding command line option: --output
;output =

# Output format.
# Corresponding command line option: --format

# Title added to data file name, printed on plots etc.
# Probably not terribly useful to set in a config file...
# Corresponding command line option: --title-extra

# Note added to the data file as metadata (key NOTE).
# Probably not terribly useful to set in a config file...

# Filename to output debug logging to.
# Debug logging is disabled if this is not set.
# Corresponding command line option: --log-file

# IP version to use for connecting to the target host.
# Valid values: 4 or 6.
# Corresponding command line option: --ipv4 or --ipv6
;ip_version = 4

# Socket timeout to pass to netperf for UDP tests (if the netperf) version
# supports it. Units of seconds.
# Corresponding command line option: --socket-timeout
;socket_timeout = 2

# Whether to interpret multiple input files as being used to scale plots.
# If not set, multiple input files are interpreted to be plotted side-by-side.
#
# Note that boolean options, if changed from the default, current cannot be
# overridden from the command line.
# Corresponding command line option: --scale-mode
;scale_mode = no

# Whether to print annotations (hostname etc) on plots.
#
# Note that boolean options, if changed from the default, current cannot be
# overridden from the command line.
# Corresponding command line option: --no-annotation

# Whether to print the test title on plots.
#
# Note that boolean options, if changed from the default, current cannot be
# overridden from the command line.
# Corresponding command line option: --no-title

# Whether to print plot legend.
#
# Note that boolean options, if changed from the default, current cannot be
# overridden from the command line.
# Corresponding command line option: --no-legend
;print_legend = yes

# Whether to always start y-axis from 0 (rather than scaling to the smallest
# data point).
#
# Note that boolean options, if changed from the default, current cannot be
# overridden from the command line.
# Corresponding command line option: --zero-y
;zero_y = no

# Whether to enable automatic log-scaling of plot axes.
# If not disabled here (or on the command line), log scales are enabled if
# the maximum data point is more than 20 times the value of the minimum.
#
# Note that boolean options, if changed from the default, current cannot be
# overridden from the command line.
# Corresponding command line option: --disable-log
;log_scale = yes

# Whether to gather extended meta data and store it in the data file.
# This may include sensitive data from the machine running the test, that
# it may not be desireable to publish. See the man page for the list of
# data gathered.
#
# Note that boolean options, if changed from the default, current cannot be
# overridden from the command line.
# Corresponding command line option: --extended-metadata
;extended_metadata = no

## Sections can specify settings overriding the global settings for
## specific tests. For instance, this sets plot output to be default
## for the RRUL test:
;[rrul]
