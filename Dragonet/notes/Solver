Scenarios:
 - load balancing: flows are equally distributed among queues
 - QoS: two classes
    - gold: requires 1 queue for every X flows up until the point where all queues are allocated
    - best effort: remaining queues, but if there are flows it gets at least one queue
      So, if there are best efforst flows, the gold class will get up to N-1 queues
    - queues are exlusively assigned to gold and best effort classes
    - inside each class -> load balancing (see above)

Solver approaches
-----------------

a) The solver knows the number of queues (e.g., number of CPUs) and produces an
   assignment of flows to queues. You can do that greedily:
    . assign the 1st flow so the the optimize function is maximized
    . assign the 2nd flow so the the optimize function is maximized
    . ...
    . assign the Nth flow optimally

b) The solver has an interface to the configuration space where it can:
   . add a flow to value
   . finalize configuration to receive a full configuration

   Again, we can operate greedily
   . assign the 1st flow optimally
   . assign the 2nd flow optimally
   . ...
   assign the Nth flow optimally
