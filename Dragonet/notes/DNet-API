Dnet iface to apps
------------------

 . create qs
 . create/destroy/move(?) sockets onto queues
 . (low level) poll queues
 . (high level?) register callbacks to sockets and event_dispatch() for all queues

 . ctl (low level), should be (at least conceptually) separate from data

Qs:
 - is this good enough?
 - what is the interface to the bulk transfer (queues)?
